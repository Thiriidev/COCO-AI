Project Description: Generative AI Chatbot for Internal Document Search
Problem It Solves

Employees in large manufacturing firms often struggle to find internal documents such as manuals, policies, and guidelines. Traditional file storage systems are inefficient, leading to wasted time and reduced productivity. For technicians and operators, this can result in longer downtimes, delays in troubleshooting, and production inefficiencies. The lack of an intuitive search experience also creates challenges for employees with lower technical skills.

Our Solution

We built a Generative AI-powered chatbot called Cocomelon AI that acts as a smart assistant for document retrieval. By ingesting uploaded manuals, guides, and policies, the chatbot allows employees to query documents in natural language—or even with simple one-word prompts—and receive accurate, context-aware responses. This reduces search time, minimizes downtime, and enables faster decision-making across manufacturing operations.

Technologies Used

AWS Lex – For conversational chatbot interface.
Amazon Bedrock – To integrate and fine-tune generative AI foundation models.
Amazon S3 – For secure storage of uploaded documents.
AWS Lambda (Node.js) – For backend logic and integration between services.
